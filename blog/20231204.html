    <p><b>Part 1</b></p>

    <p>Part 1 was really easy. Just parse each line, look for repeat numbers before and after the line, and add up the score.</p>

    <p>The only thing that tripped me up was initially I split the line on a space, but there is more white space in some lines than others,
      so I needed to split like this instead:
    </p>

    <p class="code">
      const tokens = line.split(/[ ]+/);</br>
    </p>

    <p><b>Part 2</b></p>

    <p>Part 2 was where it really got interesting.</p>

    <p>I'm sure there are a variety of ways to solve part 2, but what felt most natural to me was a dynamic programming solution with
      recursion and memoization. For those of you that remember hearing about this in college and promptly let it leave your head: this is
      when you cache/store the results of sub-problems so that you don't have to recompute them later. This is a great technique to use
      when you have a function that is called multiple times with the same input, and you want to avoid doing the same work over and over.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is the most important part of the solution:
    </p>

    <p class="code">
      let memo = {};</br>
</br>
&ensp;const getTotalCountForCard = (card) => {</br>
&ensp;if(card.wins === 0) {</br>
&ensp;&ensp;return 1;</br>
&ensp;} else if(memo[card.cardNum] != undefined) {</br>
&ensp;&ensp;return memo[card.cardNum];</br>
&ensp;} else {</br>
&ensp;&ensp;let wins = 1;</br>
&ensp;&ensp;for(let i=0; i<card.wins; i++) {</br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;wins += getTotalCountForCard(originalCards[card.cardNum+i+1]);</br>
&ensp;&ensp;}</br>
&ensp;&ensp;memo[card.cardNum] = wins;</br>
&ensp;&ensp;return wins;</br>
&ensp;}</br>
}</br>
</br>
file.on('close', () => {</br>
&ensp;let wins = 0;</br>
&ensp;for(let i=0; i<originalCards.length; i++) {</br>
&ensp;&ensp;wins += getTotalCountForCard(originalCards[i]);</br>
&ensp;}</br>
&ensp;console.log(wins);</br>
});
    </p>

    <p>
      (Higher up in the actual solution I calculate the score for each card, and then create an array of each card with its score that I use here.)
    </p>

    <p>
      Basically, the base case of this recursive function is when a card has no wins. In that case, the card only counts itself.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the card has wins, we either fetch the total tree of cards from the cache, or we calculate it recursively. Once we have a total
      for a particular card, we cache it for later so we don't have to recompute it again.
