    <p>
      I guess I'm done.
    </p>

    <p>
      I made it through day 11. Same as last year: it's not that the problems are getting too hard, it's that they're taking too long and
      with a full personal life, I can't commit to doing it anymore.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was fun while it lasted. I'll try again next year.
