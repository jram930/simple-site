    <p><b>Part 1</b></p>

    <p>
      This part wasn't too bad. Honestly, the hardest thing here was just comprehending what the puzzle was talking about.
    </p>
      
    <p>
      Once I understood what it was asking for, it was just a matter of traversing the maps to trace seed values to location values and
      finding the minimum.
    </p>

    <p><b>Part 2</b></p>

    <p>
      On the surface, part 2 sounded like it was just going to quickly be a slight modification of part 1, but boy was I wrong.
    </p>

    <p>
      Slightly tweaking the seeds to be ranges instead of single values immediately resulted in:
    </p>

    <p class="code">
      Fatal JavaScript invalid size error 169220804
    </p>

    <p>
      A quick google taught me that this meant that I exceeded the maximum array size allowed in javascript.
    </p>

    <p>
      I was stuck on this for a while and tried a bunch of random ideas, but nothing really worked for me.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eventually, I landed on a solution where I started from 0 and incremented through all possible locations. For each location,
      I worked backward through the maps checking what seed would have resulted in that location. Then I checked if any of the
      original seed ranges would have contained that seed. The first location that had a match was the answer.
    </p>

    <p>
      I was nervous this solution would be too slow, but it ran in 1 or 2 seconds, so I was pleasantly surprised.
