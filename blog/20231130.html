    <p>
      I plan on doing <a href="https://adventofcode.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">advent of code</a> this year.
    </p>

    <p>
      I did it last year, but I only ended up completing through day 12. (You can see my solutions <a href="https://github.com/jram930/aoc22" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>).
    </p>

    <p>
      I typically fail to cmplete the whole month because once you hit around day 13, the problems get hard enough that you need to set
      aside a good chunk of time to solve them (which I don`t have as a parent), but it's still fun to try.
    </p>

    <p>
      I plan on using typescript since that's my bread and butter these days. If you want to follow along, you`ll find my solutions
      <a href="https://github.com/jram930/advent-of-code-2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      I`ll probably post some explanations/walkthroughs here on my site as well (as time allows).
