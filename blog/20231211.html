    <p><b>Part 1</b></p>

    <p>
      After day 10 I was afraid day 11 would be even harder and I would need to throw in the towel, but this one was a nice break. 
    </p>

    <p>
      For part 1, I did was seemed logical and literally adjusted the galaxy map to include the extra rows and columns and then computed the
      distance between each pair of galaxies.
    </p>

    <p>
      I was tempted to over-think the shortest distance algorithm, but it was just a matter of computing the difference between the x and y
      of each galaxy and then adding them together.
    </p>

    <p><b>Part 2</b></p>

    <p>
      My solution for part 1 didn't easily extend to part 2 because if I literally created the map with the extra millions of rows and columns,
      I started hitting memory and compute limits for my program.
    </p>

    <p>
      I realized that I don't have to actually create the map, I just needed to check how many empty rows and columns there were between
      each pair, and add the extra millions to the computed distance.
