    <p><b>Part 1</b></p>

    <p>
      As usual, the first part wasn't so bad. I think the trickiest part was determining if the hand was a full house or a three of a kind.
      Here's the snippet where I did that:
    </p>

    <p class="code">
      if(!isFiveOfAKind && !isFourOfAKind) {</br>
      &ensp;let hasThreeOfAKind = false;</br>
      &ensp;for(let i=0; i<hand.length; i++) {</br>
      &ensp;&ensp;if(hand.filter((card) => card === hand[i]).length === 3) {</br>
      &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;hasThreeOfAKind = true;</br>
      &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;break;</br>
      &ensp;&ensp;}</br>
      &ensp;}</br>
      &ensp;if(hasThreeOfAKind) {</br>
      &ensp;&ensp;for(let i=0; i<hand.length; i++) {</br>
      &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if(hand.filter((card) => card === hand[i]).length === 2) {</br>
      &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;isFullHouse = true;</br>
      &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;break;</br>
      &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;}</br>
      &ensp;&ensp;}</br>
      &ensp;}</br>
      &ensp;if(hasThreeOfAKind && !isFullHouse) {</br>
      &ensp;&ensp;isThreeOfAKind = true;</br>
      &ensp;}</br>
      }</br>
    </p>

    <p>
      Basically, I checked if there was a three of a kind, then I checked if there was also a pair. If there wasn't a pair, then it was just
      a three of a kind. If there was a pair, then it was a full house.
    </p>

    <p>
      The other types of hands were pretty straight-forward to check for.
    </p>

    <p><b>Part 2</b></p>

    <p>
      To be honest, I almost gave up on this one.
    </p>

    <p>
      I got it basically right pretty quickly, but whenever I submitted the answer to the site it said I was wrong. I spent an hour or two
      pouring over print statements of what was going on looking for the various edge cases I was missing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Most of the edge cases were in situations where there were multiple wildcards, but in at least one case I had focused on the wildcards
      so much that I had messed up the logic for a normal hand with no wildcard.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eventually, I ironed out all the bugs and got the right answer.
