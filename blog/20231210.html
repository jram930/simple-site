    <p><b>Part 1</b></p>

    <p>
      I think it would be easy to over-complicate part 1, but all I needed to do was look at the "pipe" at the current position and determine
      which direction to go. I kept track of the previous position so I could determine which way to go next (since we can't go backward).
    </p>

    <p class="code">
      if(pipe === 'F' && (previousPos === undefined || previousPos.row === currentPos.row)) {</br>
        &ensp;// Go down</br>
        &ensp;currentPos.row++;</br>
        } else if(pipe === 'F') {</br>
        &ensp;// Go right</br>
        &ensp;currentPos.col++;</br>
        } else if(pipe === '|' && (previousPos === undefined || previousPos.row === currentPos.row - 1)) {</br>
        &ensp;// Go down</br>
        &ensp;currentPos.row++;</br>
        } else if (pipe === '|') {</br>
        &ensp;// Go up</br>
        &ensp;currentPos.row--;</br>
        } else if(pipe === '7' && (previousPos === undefined || previousPos.row === currentPos.row)) {</br>
        &ensp;// Go down</br>
        &ensp;currentPos.row++;</br>
        } else if(pipe === '7') {</br>
        &ensp;// Go left</br>
        &ensp;currentPos.col--;</br>
        } else if(pipe === 'L' && (previousPos === undefined || previousPos.row === currentPos.row)) {</br>
        &ensp;// Go up</br>
        &ensp;currentPos.row--;</br>
        } else if(pipe === 'L') {</br>
        &ensp;// Go right</br>
        &ensp;currentPos.col++;</br>
        } else if(pipe === 'J' && (previousPos === undefined || previousPos.row === currentPos.row)) {</br>
        &ensp;// Go up</br>
        &ensp;currentPos.row--;</br>
        } else if(pipe === 'J') {</br>
        &ensp;// Go left</br>
        &ensp;currentPos.col--;</br>
        } else if(pipe === '-' && (previousPos === undefined || previousPos.col === currentPos.col - 1)) {</br>
        &ensp;// Go right</br>
        &ensp;currentPos.col++;</br>
        } else if (pipe === '-') {</br>
        &ensp;// Go left</br>
        &ensp;currentPos.col--;</br>
        }</br>
    </p>

    <p>
      Every time you take a step, you increment a counter, and then the answer at the end is this distance divided by 2, since halfway
      through the loop is always the farthest point.
    </p>

    <p><b>Part 2</b></p>

    <p>
      In short, part 2 was insane.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this part of the challenge, we had to find how many squares are "inside" of the main loop of pipe. Even more challenging: spaces
      that are between adjacent/parallel pipes are considered "outside" the loop.
    </p>

    <p>
      I feel like there might be a lot of creative solutions for this problem, but what I landed on was "blowing up" the pipe map so that
      the tight spaces between parallel pipes were actual squares that could be considered part of any traversing algorithm. Any square I 
      added this way I marked with an X (unless it was an extension of a pipe) so that it wouldn't be counted at the end.
    </p>

    <p>
      I surrounded the map with O's, indicating "outside" and then I alternated between starting from the top or starting from the bottom
      and turned .'s into O's as I found they were adjacent. I kept looping this way until the count of inside spaces stopped changing.
