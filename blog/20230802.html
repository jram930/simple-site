    <p>The web has gotten boring and most sites are over-complicated.</p>
    <p>What happened to the old days when people would just upload a couple of simple html files with some interesting CSS styles?</p>
    <p>I'm not sure what types of posts I'll be putting on this site, but there's something satisfying about spinning up a simple and
      efficient site in a handful of minutes where I can say anything I want to anyone in the world.</p>
    <p>We shouldn't need react, vue, LLMs, twitter, facebook, and a thousand layers of indirection and abstraction to post on the bulletin
      board of the internet and connect with other people.</p>
