    <p>
      I haven't posted anything in a couple of months. I've been on parental leave. It's been great. I've been able to spend a lot of
      quality time with my family and bond with the new baby (number 4!).

      It's wild to me that in this country there are still so many people who don't get this benefit. I'm lucky to work for a company that
      values work/life balance and family time.

      It's tough to go back to work, but I'm still excited to get back to it. There are a lot of projects I'm excited to work on.
