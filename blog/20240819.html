    <p>
      The last couple of places I've worked at have had basically no formal staging environment other than local development on your own
      machine. When you're working on a new feature/product, you just had to "fake it" locally as best you can, get it into production
      (typically behind a feature flag to hide it from customers), and then see if it works as expected on real production data.
    </p>

    <p>
      To be fair, there have also been some tools/scripts to get some production data into your local environment, but they were always
      burdensome, clunky, and a little nerve-racking to have customer data (even just temporarily) on your local computer.
    </p>

    <p>
      I always felt a bit of a stigma and ashamed to tell other engineers at other companies that we didn't have a staging environment. It
      seemed unprofessional to me and like we weren't doing it "right".
    </p>

    <p>
      However, now that I've worked at a handful of places that have all been in the same boat, I'm realizing that this is just the reality
      of the industry. Maybe if you work at a mega-corporation with a huge engineering team and a lot of resources, you can afford to have a
      staging environment and keep it up-to-date with production data, but for most "scrappy" companies, it's just not feasible.
    </p>

    <p>
      Maintaining a staging environment is incredibly expensive and requires a lot of thought and maintenance. I assume it's worth it, once
      you have it set up, but 100% replicating production is no small feat. Even if you do, no environment will literally be an exact
      duplicate of production, so you will still run into issues where something works in staging but not in production.
    </p>

    <p>
      I've come around to the reality of not having a proper staging environment and using a combination of local development and feature
      flags to roll things out safely into production. Instead of investing tons of time in a staging environment, I think the "scrappy"
      types of companies that I tend to prefer to work for would be better off investing in better monitoring and quick rollback mechanisms,
      so if you do roll something bad out to production, you can quickly notice it and roll it back.
